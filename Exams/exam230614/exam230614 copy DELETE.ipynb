    "\n",
    "1.1 Instructions:\n",
    "1. Complete the problems by following instructions.\n",
    "2. When done, submit this file with your solutions saved, following the instruction sheet.\n",
    "   This exam has 3 problems for a total of 40 points, to pass you need 20 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 Some general hints and information:\n",
    "• Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "• Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought —\n",
    "  this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "• Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "• This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "• If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "• I (Benny) will visit the exam room at around 10:30 to see if there are any questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3 Tips for free text answers:\n",
    "• Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "• If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance\n",
    "  $f(x)=x^2$ will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and $$f(x)=x^2$$ will become an equation line, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x)=x^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y=y \\mid X=x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1.4 Finally some rules:\n",
    "• You may not communicate with others during the exam, for example:\n",
    "  – You cannot ask for help in StackOverflow or other such help forums during the Exam.\n",
    "  – You may not communicate with AI’s, for instance ChatGPT.\n",
    "  – Your on-line and off-line activity is being monitored according to the examination rules.\n",

    "### Reasoning about the model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The predicted-versus-true salary plot shows that the model captures the overall increasing relationship between predicted and actual salaries, as most points follow the general direction of the identity line. This indicates that the model has learned relevant patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is substantial dispersion around the identity line, especially for mid- to high-salary values. For a given predicted salary, the true salaries vary widely, which suggests a high level of prediction uncertainty and variance in the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot also indicates regression toward the mean: lower salaries tend to be overestimated, while higher salaries are often underestimated. This suggests that the model struggles to accurately predict extreme salary values, possibly due to limited model complexity, missing explanatory variables, or noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the model demonstrates moderate predictive performance. It captures the general trend in the data but lacks precision for individual predictions, particularly at the extremes of the salary range.\n"
