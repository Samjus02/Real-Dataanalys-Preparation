    "The DKW confidence band gives a uniform confidence region for the true CDF $$F(x)$$ of the residuals.

    "\n",
    "This band tells us how uncertain our estimate of the residual distribution is due to the finite sample size:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A narrow band means the residual distribution is estimated precisely.  \n",
    "- A wide band means greater uncertainty about the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of model checking, the confidence band can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assess whether the empirical residual distribution is compatible with a proposed theoretical distribution (for example, a normal distribution).  \n",
    "- Compare residual distributions from different models.  \n",
    "- Detect skewness or heavy tails and get a visual sense of whether there are more extreme residuals than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a theoretical CDF for the residuals lies systematically outside the band, this suggests that the assumed distribution is not in agreement with the data.\n",

    "The DKW confidence band gives a uniform confidence region for the true CDF $$F(x)$$ of the residuals.

    "\n",
    "This band tells us how uncertain our estimate of the residual distribution is due to the finite sample size:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A narrow band means the residual distribution is estimated precisely.  \n",
    "- A wide band means greater uncertainty about the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of model checking, the confidence band can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assess whether the empirical residual distribution is compatible with a proposed theoretical distribution (for example, a normal distribution).  \n",
    "- Compare residual distributions from different models.  \n",
    "- Detect skewness or heavy tails and get a visual sense of whether there are more extreme residuals than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a theoretical CDF for the residuals lies systematically outside the band, this suggests that the assumed distribution is not in agreement with the data.\n",
