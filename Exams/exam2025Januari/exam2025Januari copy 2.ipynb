    "## Instructions:\n",
    "1. Complete the problems by following instructions.\n",
    "2. When done, submit this file with your solutions saved, following the instruction sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam has 3 problems for a total of 40 points, to pass you need\n",
    "20 points. The bonus will be added to the score of the exam and rounded afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for free text answers\n",
    "* Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "* If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance `$f(x)=x^2$` will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and `$$f(x) = x^2$$` will become an equation line, as follows\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2$$\n",
    "Another example is `$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$` which renders as\n",
    "$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finally some rules:\n",
    "* You may not communicate with others during the exam, for example:\n",
    "    * You cannot ask for help in Stack-Overflow or other such help forums during the Exam.\n",
    "    * You may not communicate with AI's, for instance ChatGPT.\n",
    "    * Your on-line and off-line activity is being monitored according to the examination rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good luck!"

    "\n",
    "To construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the expected cost on the test data, Hoeffding’s inequality was used. This approach relies on the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bounded per-sample cost**  \n",
    "   Each individual prediction incurs a finite cost. From the problem specification, the possible costs per sample are:\n",
    "   - True Negative: $0$\n",
    "   - True Positive: $100$\n",
    "   - False Positive: $120$\n",
    "   - False Negative: $600$  \n",
    "   Hence, the per-sample cost random variable is bounded in the interval $[0, 600]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independent and identically distributed samples (i.i.d.)**  \n",
    "   The test data samples are assumed to be independent and drawn from the same underlying distribution. This is required for Hoeffding’s inequality to hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fixed decision threshold**  \n",
    "   The threshold used to compute the test cost was selected using the validation data and is treated as fixed when evaluating performance on the test set. The uncertainty in threshold selection is therefore not accounted for in the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Average cost as a sample mean**  \n",
    "   The reported test cost is the empirical mean of the per-sample costs. Hoeffding’s inequality provides a confidence interval for this mean without making any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Distribution-free guarantee**  \n",
    "   No assumptions such as normality of the cost distribution are made. Hoeffding’s inequality is distribution-free, but this also means that the resulting confidence interval may be conservative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these assumptions, the constructed interval contains the true expected test cost with probability at least $95\\%$.\n"
