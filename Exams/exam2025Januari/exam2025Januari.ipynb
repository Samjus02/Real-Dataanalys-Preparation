    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "1. Complete the problems by following instructions.\n",
    "2. When done, submit this file with your solutions saved, following the instruction sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam has 3 problems for a total of 40 points, to pass you need\n",
    "20 points. The bonus will be added to the score of the exam and rounded afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for free text answers\n",
    "* Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "* If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance `$f(x)=x^2$` will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and `$$f(x) = x^2$$` will become an equation line, as follows\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2$$\n",
    "Another example is `$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$` which renders as\n",
    "$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finally some rules:\n",
    "* You may not communicate with others during the exam, for example:\n",
    "    * You cannot ask for help in Stack-Overflow or other such help forums during the Exam.\n",
    "    * You may not communicate with AI's, for instance ChatGPT.\n",
    "    * Your on-line and off-line activity is being monitored according to the examination rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good luck!"

Compute the Singular Value Decomposition, i.e. construct the three matrices $U$, $D$, $V$ such that if $X$ is the data matrix of shape `n_samples x n_dimensions` then $X = UDV^T$. Put the resulting matrices in their variables, check that the shapes align with the instructions in the code cell. Finally, extract the first right and left singular vectors and store those as 1-d arrays in the instructed variables.\n",

    "3. [3p] With the number of components chosen in part 2, construct the best approximating matrix with the rank as the number of components. Explain what each row represents in the approximating matrix in terms of the original data, write your answer as free text in the Markdown cell below as instructed in the cells.\n",
    "4. [4p] Create a vector which corresponds to the row-wise (Euclidean) distance between the original matrix `problem1_data`and the approximating matrix `problem1_approximation` and plot the empirical distribution function of that distance. Based on the empirical distribution function choose a threshold such that 10 samples are above it and the rest below. Store the 10 samples in the instructed variable."

The pages of the website are just numbers in the dataset $0,1,2,\\ldots$ and each row consists of a user, a source and a destination page. This signifies that the user was on the source page and clicked a link leading them to the destination page. The goal is to improve the user experience by decreasing load time of the next page visited, as such we need a good estimate for the next site likely to be visited. We will model this using a homogeneous Markov chain, each row in the data-file then corresponds to a single realization of a transition. \n",
