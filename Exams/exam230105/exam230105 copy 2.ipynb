    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "1. Complete the problems by following instructions.\n",
    "2. When done, submit this file with your solutions saved, following the instruction sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam has 3 problems for a total of 40 points, to pass you need\n",
    "20 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "* I (Benny) will visit the exam room at around 10:30 to see if there are any questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for free text answers\n",
    "* Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "* If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance `$f(x)=x^2$` will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and `$$f(x) = x^2$$` will become an equation line, as follows\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2$$\n",
    "Another example is `$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$` which renders as\n",
    "$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finally some rules:\n",
    "* You may not communicate with others during the exam, for example:\n",
    "    * You cannot ask for help in Stack-Overflow or other such help forums during the Exam.\n",
    "    * You may not communicate with AI's, for instance ChatGPT.\n",
    "    * Your on-line and off-line activity is being monitored according to the examination rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good luck!"

    "\n",
    "Since the target variable is counts, a reasonable loss function is to consider the target variable as Poisson distributed where the parameter follows $\\lambda = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$ where $\\alpha$ is a vector (slope) and $\\beta$ is a number (intercept). That is, the parameter is the exponential of a linear function. The reason we chose this as our parameter, is that it is always positive which is when the Poisson distribution is defined. To be specific we make the following assumption about our conditional density of $Y \\mid X$,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    f_{Y \\mid X} (y,x) = \\frac{\\lambda^{y} e^{-\\lambda}}{y !}, \\quad \\lambda(x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the lecture notes, (4.2) that in this case we should consider the log-loss (entropy) and that according to (4.2.1 Maximum Likelihood and regression) we can consider the conditional log-likelihood. Follow the steps of Example 1 and Example 2 in section (4.2) to derive the loss that needs to be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: when taking the log of the conditional density you will find that the term that contains the $y!$ does not depend on $\\lambda$ and as such does not depend on $\\alpha,\\beta$, it can thus be discarded. This will be essential due to numerical issues with factorials.\n",
